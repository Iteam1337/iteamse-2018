## Overview

The repositories are split up in separate folders in `packages/`.

A [Now-preview](now.json) is set up for each commit in pull requests, they'll have the following format: `COMMIT_HASH.iteam.now.sh`, please make sure that when you're done with a pull request and would like to have it reviewed that you include this link for easier reviewing.

When a pull-request gets merged to master [Travis](.travis.yaml) will automatically build and push the new images to `Iteam1337`'s docker-repo and will automatically get deployed.
